# LoveAajKal

Kastur Koul

LoveAajKal is a website that will help our client assist in the matchmaking process and allow match seekers (or their friends and family) to find matches for themselves (with her help if they would like)

# Tools
Our choice of language for this project is Python. We will also use Django, which is a Python-based, free, open-sourced web framework that follows model-template-views architectural patterns. We will likely be using a database like MySQL or SQLite. In terms of coordination tools, we will be sharing our code over GitHub, managing communication very frequently over GroupMe, and maintaining contact with our client through email. 

# Deployment 
We are planning on deploying and hosting the project for public and client access on Amazon Web Services (more information and link to webstie will be available in the future).
